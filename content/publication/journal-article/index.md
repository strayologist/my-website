abstract: Astrobiology is an emerging and interdisciplinary scientific field
  that aims at studying and understanding life in the universe, with research
  topics including the origin of life and the feasibility of life existing and
  being detected elsewhere in the universe. In this article, we highlight the
  critical role that astrobiology plays toward inspiring students and the
  general public toward space exploration. The cross-disciplinary nature of the
  field brings together scientists from various backgrounds, breaking down silos
  that exist in today's scientific community in India. Finally, astrobiology has
  continuously played a pivotal role in shaping outer space exploration programs
  and will be an important scientific area of development for the Indian Space
  Research Organization as well. The formation of the Indian National Space
  Promotion and Authorization Centre (IN-SPACe) body and the emerging New Space
  ecosystem in India are discussed, as they offer unique opportunities to bring
  down the cost, time, and programmatic challenges traditionally faced by
  Astrobiology missions.
